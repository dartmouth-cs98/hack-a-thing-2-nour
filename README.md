# React native app

### Short description of what you attempted to build: 
I attempted to build a simple react native app. I used Expo to render it on my phone and it turned out super simple and easy to use. This makes me super excited to work on my own group project using this tech stack.
### Who did what (if you worked with someone else): 
I worked on my own
### What you learned: 
- I refreshed my memory on how react works, but also got to work with hooks and providers. I understood the meaning of the following terms:
- View
- StyleSheet
- I also got to explore the react-native-paper library 
### What didnâ€™t work: 
I had a few issues with git and creating an expo app within the github repo I made and it took me longer than it should have to figure it out
